Convert the txt-exported cherrytree nodes into a directory structure

This might be helpful because other note taking applications can import directory structures.

Really quick and dirty script. Should be executed in the directory which has all the txt files of the exported cherrytree nodes.

Example:
The exported text node `root--Homework--Calc-something.txt` will be moved in the directory `root/Homework/Calc-something.txt`.

Zip the new directory and it is ready to be imported somewhere else.

### Problems

No picture export.
